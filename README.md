# faceRecognitionAndSoundPlayUsingArduino-JetsonNano
When Jetson nano performs facial recognition and finds a learner, it signals Arduino Uno via serial communication and Arduino Uno receives it to generate the music that was originally written.

# Abstract
Using Jetson nono and Arduino, we made a simple face recognition type sound reproduction machine.
It can be used for something interesting by playing music associated with a person's face.
Currently, the machine learns one person's face and plays music accordingly.
(The code is designed to be able to learn multiple people.)
